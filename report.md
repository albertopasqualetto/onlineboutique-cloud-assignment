# The Report
## Deploying the original application in GKE
We created the cluster from GKE dashboard, choosing the standard configuration (zone, cluster name, node count ...).

Then we cloned the repository;
 and we connected to the cluster with 
**gcloud container clusters get-credentials onlineboutique**

***kubectl apply -f ./release/kubernetes-manifests.yaml***

We verified the deployment was succesfull obtaining the ip address of the frontends load balancer with ***kubectl get services frontend-external*** and throw output of the load generator with ***kubectl logs loadgenerator-5fcfd6896b-q4dlv***

Explain the Autopilot mod.

## Analyzing the provided configuration

## Deploying the load generator on a local machine

We build the image of the load generator ***microservices-demo/src/loadgenerator/Dockerfile*** using the command ***docker buildx build path/to/Dockerfile parent***. Then we ran the container with ***docker run -e FRONTEND_ADDR=[ADDRESS] -e USERS=10 [IMAGE ID]*** and we analyzed the output and we understood that it was accesible outside.

## Deploying automatically the load generator in Google Cloud

- We took from "Running MPI applications" the Terraform-related files (`simple_deployment.tf`, `variables.tf`, `parse-tf-state.py`, `setup.sh`) and we modified them to run an image with docker engine installed (`boot_disk.initialize_params.image="cos-cloud/cos-117-lts"`) within our GCP project.
- We created the ansible ? `upload_build_run_docker.yml` to upload the Locust loadgenerator Dockerfile to the GCP project, build and run it. # TODO .env?

# TODO change loadgenerator folder

# TODO using kustomize

# TODO test new automated deployment.tf

## Canary Release

We deployed a Canary Release strategy to introduce a new version of the microservice `frontend`. This strategy ensures a gradual and safe transition from `v1` to `v2` of the service while monitoring system performance and user experience.

---

### Steps

#### 1. Dockerfile Version

We created new Docker images (`albertopasqualetto/oba-frontend:v2`, `albertopasqualetto/oba-frontend:v3`) with small differences between each version.

#### 2. Setting Up Istio with Helm

We installed and set up Istio as outlined in the documentation:

```bash
# Add Istio Helm repository
helm repo add istio https://istio-release.storage.googleapis.com/charts
helm repo update

# Install Istio base
helm install istio-base istio/base -n istio-system

# Install Istiod
helm install istio-base istio/base -n istio-system

# Install Ingress Gateway
helm install istio-ingressgateway istio/gateway -n istio-system --wait
```

#### 3. Setting Up Prometheus with Helm

We installed Prometheus to analyze the traffic:

```bash
helm repo add prometheus-community https://prometheus-community.github.io/helm-charts
helm repo update
helm install prometheus prometheus-community/prometheus --namespace istio-system
```

#### 4. Setting Up Grafana

We installed Grafana to plot the results provided by Prometheus queries:

```bash
helm repo add grafana https://grafana.github.io/helm-charts
```

#### 5. Deploying Frontend Versions

- **Deploy Primary Frontend Version:**

  ```bash
  kubectl apply -k .
  ```

- **Deploy Frontend v2:**

  ```bash
  kubectl apply -f ./canary-version/frontend-v2
  ```

#### 6. Configuring Istio

- **Istio Gateway Configuration:**

  ```bash
  kubectl apply -f gateway.yaml
  ```

- **VirtualService Configuration:**
  
  Configured to split traffic, with 75% routed to `v1` and 25% routed to `v2` initially:

  ```bash
  kubectl apply -f ./canary-release/frontend-virtualservice.yaml
  ```

- **DestinationRule Configuration:**

  Defined subsets for `v1` and `v2` using appropriate labels:

  ```bash
  kubectl apply -f ./canary-release/frontend-destinationrule.yaml
  ```

#### 7. Generating Traffic

We used Locust to generate traffic and test the Canary Release deployment.

- **Locustfile:**

  ```python
  from locust import HttpUser, task, between

  class FrontendUser(HttpUser):
      host = "http://34.27.165.38"
      wait_time = between(1, 5)

      @task
      def index(self):
          self.client.get("/")

      @task(2)
      def product_page(self):
          self.client.get("/product/OLJCESPC7Z")
  ```

- **Using Locust Interface:**

  In the Locust interface, we set the number of users to generate requests per second and monitored the systemâ€™s performance.

  ![Locust Interface](./images/locust-interface.png)

- **Monitoring with Prometheus and Grafana:**

  We analyzed traffic and performance metrics using Prometheus queries and Grafana dashboards.

#### 8. Automating the Canary Release with Flagger

- **Flagger Installation:**

  ```bash
  kubectl apply -k github.com/fluxcd/flagger/kustomize/istio
  ```

- **Flagger Canary Configuration:**

  ```yaml
  apiVersion: flagger.app/v1beta1
  kind: Canary
  metadata:
    name: frontend
    namespace: default
  spec:
    provider: istio
    targetRef:
      apiVersion: apps/v1
      kind: Deployment
      name: frontend
    service:
      port: 80
      hosts:
        - "*"
    analysis:
      interval: 1m
      threshold: 5
      maxWeight: 50
      stepWeight: 10
      metrics:
        - name: request-success-rate
          threshold: 99
        - name: request-duration
          threshold: 500
  ```

- **Monitoring Canary Progress:**

  We monitored the progress by analyzing metrics and gradually shifting traffic:

  ```bash
  kubectl get canaries
  ```

---

### Results

- **Traffic Generation with Locust:**

  Traffic was generated correctly, as shown in the Locust interface:

  ![Requests](./images/requests.png)

- **Prometheus Metrics:**

  Queries showed the expected traffic distribution:

  ![Prometheus Query](./images/prom-perc-query.png)

- **Grafana Dashboard:**

  The plotted data demonstrated the performance of both versions:
